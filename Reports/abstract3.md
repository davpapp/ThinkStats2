Despite playing specific positions and zones, NBA players take shots from all over the court. The location of the shot is important in determining the efficiency of the shot and the chance of being blocked. We took data from the 2016-2017 NBA year from Stephen Curry and used clustering to divide his shots into clusters based on region. Our goal was to see which clustering algorithm produces clusters most consistent with NBA positions.
