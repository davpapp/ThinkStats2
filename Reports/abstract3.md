## Finding NBA Players with Similar Styles

Willem Thorbecke and David Papp

Players in the NBA are often compared to others, both active and retired, based on similar play styles. For example, it is common to hear statements such as “Russell Westbrook is the new Derrick Rose”. The purpose of our project is to apply machine learning in the form of clustering to see which players are actually similar based on 22 variables. We successfully generated clusters of players that are very similar quantitatively. It is up to the reader to decide whether this is qualitatively true.
