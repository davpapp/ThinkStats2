# Report 3 Review
# by David Papp

#### 1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?

The motivating question is to determine whether marriage is a good predictor of political views.
The abstract is nice and succinct. Isn't marital status a good predictor of political views regardless of whether there might be confounding variables? I agree that you haven't proved causation, but it can be a good predictor regardless.

#### 2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?

Data's source and date are mentioned (GSS). Maybe also mention who collected the data for GSS? 

#### 3) What analyses did the author perform?

The author performs multinomial regression. It'd be valuable to see the correlation coefficient on age and sex. It would give a good sense for scale. Otherwise, it's hard to conceptualize how much 0.03 in effect size accounts for.
However, the R^2 value you included is also good.

#### 4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?

Yes. Author mentions the statistical significance of the correlation between political views and marriage, as well as the R^2 term.

#### 5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?

Yes. One small change might to mark for the 2nd and 3rd plots how much the correlation coefficients have changed in order to make it easier for the reader to interpret. Otherwise, great balance.


#### 6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?
Yes indeed. Great flow and grammar.
