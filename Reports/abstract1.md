#Do Midwestern colleges have better ACT scores?
### by David Papp

#### Abstract
It is often rumored that colleges in the Midwest prefer ACT scores while colleges in other regions prefer SAT Scores. The goal of this article is to explore the relationship between SAT and ACT scores in the Midwest and other regions. The data used was collected from the US Department of Education for the years 2014-15. Comparing just the means of ACT scores shows that the Midwest scores slightly higher on average: 23.48 vs 23.17. However, a better statistic might be to compare the ratio of ACT/SAT scores. The Midwest has a slightly higher ratio (0.969) than other regions (0.960). Although we cannot deduce any causation, we can draw inferences as to what causes these differences. One explanation might be the fact that students applying to Midwestern colleges spend more time studying for the ACT.
