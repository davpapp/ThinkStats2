# Report 2 Review
# by David Papp

#### 1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?

Does it get warmer before precipitation? The question is guided by a common weather myth. The question is engaging
and provides the right amount of info (for example, it doesn't detail exactly how many hours "before" means).

#### 2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?
 US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

#### 3) What analyses did the author perform?
First, the author performs a visible check for an obvious relationship between 3 day temperature and precipitation.
This is a good introduction. 
Next, the author plots two CDFs for separate locations. The graphs answer the question very well and are easy to 
interpret. It m

#### 4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?
Yes. However, it might be interesting to see how different parameters would affect the results. For example,
what about just looking at the day before it rains (rather than the 3 day moving average)? If you felt so inclined,
I think you could devise a model with higher explanatory power.


#### 5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?
Yes. The analysis is very understandable, except perhaps for the last part (running the regression). Which city's 
data did you run the regression on? What is the formula you're using? In the explanation, you mention
a "1 degree deviation": is this a positive deviation? Good work with declaring it statistically insignificant. 
I'd like to see the regression figure here (not just in the jupyter notebook). 

#### 6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?
Only noticed one typo (CTRL-F: still don a raincoat). I'd definitely include the figure from running your 
logistical regression. The figures look great overall.
