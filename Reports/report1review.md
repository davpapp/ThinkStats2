# Review of Sung's Report 1
### by David Papp

#####1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?
The motivating question is whether money buys happiness. It is unclear whether the article is looking for correlation or causation but this is fine in the introduction.

#####2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?
The report relies on data from the General Social Survey. The report does not mention who produced this data.

#####3) What analyses did the author perform?
The author plots a PMF of the happiness levels for low income (lowest 5%) and high income (highest 5%) groups. He compares the marriage happiness and work importance values for the two groups.

#####4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?
Yes. From graphs mentioned above, the author argues that higher income groups rank higher in all of the three categories (happiness, marriage happiness, work importance). The author chooses compelling visual evidence as well as provide summary statistics (mean) to support his point. 

#####5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?
Yes. The article is very clear and the graphs are easy to interpret. The author provides enough evidence to support his point and provides reasonable theories to explain patterns in data. It might be interesting to see more complex graphs and analysis. For example, how would the graphs change if income was broken into more categories. Finally, the author does a great job of pointing out important details, such as the fact that his analysis only seems to establish correlation and not causation.

#####6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?
Yes. The article is correctly formatted. There are no noticable errors in spelling or grammar. The author uses first person which works well.
